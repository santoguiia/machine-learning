For this project, you will implement and analyse:

1) Value iteration for a grid-world (Question 1)
2) Q-Learning from scratch for Example 6.6: Cliff Walking from the Sutton & Barto book (page 132).
3) Q-Learning for PacMan (Questions 6, 7 and Question 9)

Among other things, you will deliver the implemented code and a report where you:
- describe the MDP (state space, action space, reward function, environment dynamics)
- present your solution
- show results, e.g., the plot of the rewards during training episodes and experiment with the parameters of the algorithms.


Important:

- Assessment:

        - your code (with the report) will be evaluated for technical correctness and for achieving results similar to the expected ones.

        - your presentation and answers to questions about the project and delivered code will also be evaluated, as in an oral exam.

- Academic dishonesty: your code will be checked against solutions found on internet and also using software capable of detecting logical redundancy against other submissions. If fraud/plagiarism is confirmed, appropriate measures will be taken, including a zero grade for the assignment."
